#CASE - EVENT REGISTTRATION

Case-Crayon-Quality Assurance Specialist â€“ Vivek Hosatty Moorthi


This is a **webdriverIO + Cucumber** framework.
I have tried to implment the POM (Page object model) in this project.


**Setup :**

1. Clone the repo **"Git clone https://github.com/Hosatty/TestingTuesday.git"**

2. Open the project in VS code or Terminal run the command **"npm install"** - This will install all the dependencies

4. To run the test **"npm run wdio"** - This will trigger the execution
